# datatable

A Datatable widget is needed.

Exenstion of a List Component.


## use cases

The Master / Detail pattern is where the Master is a List, and the detail is the Form. Many many apps naturally use this pattern.

However, somtimes you need to show more data in the list with many fields, and sorting them. Its similar to any DB IDE in many ways.

Also, see the Audio proposal where the classic use case for a datatable is shown.
