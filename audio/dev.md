## Sponsorship 1

Make a sponsorship for 100 euro to make a gio based lofimusic.

This is built with golang and wasm. So alot of the existing code can be reused.

It uses Service works with a proper manifest, so it supoorts A2HS and so itcan be added to your Homescreen on Desktop and Mobile, and thus gives an app sore like UX without needed app store signing.

Code : https://github.com/maxence-charriere/lofimusic
Demo: https://lofimusic.app/lofigirl

Use gio component for Nav though, cause it works on all screen sizes.

It sources the music from youtube, so no server needed.
