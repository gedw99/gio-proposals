# WebView

Typically you wan an InProcess and OutOfProcess one.

InProcess is when the webview in rendered within a part of the screen.

OutOfProcess is when it opens a new Window. This is highly useful for Login windows because even on Mobile it shows that Https is being used.

Out of Process is way easier and more useful in many use cases, and so i only concentrait on that for now.

## Compile targets

Web is actually a target because you want it to open a new tab typically
