# dev

generates best practice golang backends and froent ends

We can use this for building gio apps

and also for modules that get built.

all it does is copy the code from a git repo.
- you then have to modify the go mod line "module github.com/create-go-app/net_http-go-template". easy.

all the examples need redis and postresql currently.

we can modify to genji and mae our own templates.
