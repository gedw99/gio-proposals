# gio-proposals

Itâ€™s designed for developers looking to get going with https://gioui.org/ apps fast.

But also for those interested in extending gio too.

## CI

CI builds all the proposal examples and deploys them.

- This is useful because users can very quickly see a demo of the code they are looking at.
- Eventually it will host a web, desktop and mobile version of each demo.

Also I am starting to focus on what the idiomatic aspects of gio project structure as well as useful patterns.

## Awesomes

List of awesome gio repos...

## Audio 

Audio component proposal.

Oto v2 looks perfect and reuses a well supported existing golang package.

## Modularity

Code and patterns for buildng modular gio apps. Typically needed for larger apps.

## Navigation

Gio needs a Navigator to allow paterns like deepinking, sharing, universal links.

## Datatable

A Datatable Component is needed. Extension of a List Component.

## Db

Gio needs a decent DB with no CGO.

Genji supports Desktop and Mobile, Web. For Web it can be compiled with golang wasm or tinygo

Soon it will support an WASM indexedDB based driver too, and so gain persistance for GIo Web.

Genji is unique in that it can support schema and no schema approaches and is a well supported golang package.

## Db Search

Offers global search for gio apps.

## Networking

There are many ways to manage the network aspects in GIO.

GRPC, NATS, Websockets, http, go-kit, etc, etc

Various examples and proposals for this...

## Notify

In tandan with Navigation Component, this allows both in-app and out-of-app notifications.

## Pack

For signing and packing apps for Web, Desktop, Mobile, IOT.

## Scripting

For using scripting / interpreters withing gio apps.

## SEO

Approach for building Web apps where the app can still be scraped by Google, etc.

## Servers

Many standard things are needed for most projects, and in order for Community Demonstrations to be built up with GIO, some standard serevrs would make it easier.

Making Gio demos that use these servers is the first step.

Then when a demo for GIO needs some server aspect to show a complete demo it can be used.

CI and CD is then also easier for the Demos.

Email.

Identity.

DB and File Storage.

Backup.

## Speech

Proposal for how to use Test to Speech and Speech to Text.
