# Signing

Gogio has some support, but a unified way of doing this is useful.

A Config file for this i think is useful to help unify the developer UX, in that the tool can look at the Config file and based on the target look up the Signing keys.

If there are no signing keys, then the CLI can help walk the Developer through the stages, which are probably asynchronise whilst they go to an URL and get some key, etc and place it in the right location on the OS, such that the Tooling CLI can rerun.
