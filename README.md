## CI

CI builds all the proposal examples and deploys them.

- This is useful because users can very quickly see a demo of the code they are looking at.
- Eventually it will host a web, desktop and mobile version of each demo.


## Awesomes

List of awesome gio repos...

## Audio 

Audio component proposal.

## Modularity

Code and patterns for buildng modular gio apps. Typically needed for larger apps.

## Navigation

Gio needs a Navigator to allow features like deepinking, sharing, universal links.

## Datatable

A Datatable widget is needed. Extension of a List Component.

## Db

A DB with no CGO.

## Db Search

## Networking

There are many ways to manage the network aspects in GIO.

Various examples and proposals for this ...

## Notify

Both in-app and out-of-app notifications.

## Pack

For signing and packing apps for Web, Desktop, Mobile, IOT.

## Scripting

For using scripting / interpreters withing gio apps.

## SEO

Approach for building HTML Web apps with GIO, allowing the app to be indexed by Google, etc.

## Servers

Some standard things are needed for most projects, and in order for Community Demonstrations to be built up with GIO, some standard server would make it easier.

Making Gio demos that use these servers is the first step.

Then when a demo for GIO needs some server aspect to show a complete demo it can be used.

CI and CD is then also easier for the Demos.

Email.

Identity.

DB and File Storage.

Backup.

## Speech

Proposal for how to use Test to Speech and Speech to Text.
