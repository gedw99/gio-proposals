# Bluetooth

gio has haptics demo which is a buzzer.

But it can only work in Native Desktop or Mobile, cause safari is only browser that does not support the vibrate API.

- all browsers supported, but not Safari ( desktop or mobile )

## external hardware

But what about bluetooth in web ?

So what about using bluetooth to allow haptics via bluetooth for games consoles etc.
